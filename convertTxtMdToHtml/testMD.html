<h1>Example TIL Post</h1>
<p>Today I learned how to review <a href="https://github.com/kliu57/go-go-web">some else's</a> Open Source project on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and file issues!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>First, I cloned their project on my local machine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, I followed their instructions on how to run the program.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once I was familiar with how to run the program, I tried to run some edge cases to find bugs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I found a bug, I went to the Issues tab of their GitHub project and clicked New issue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I gave the issue a title and short description as well as a screenshot and submitted the issue.</p>
